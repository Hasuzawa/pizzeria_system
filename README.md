## UML
A very simple UML model for pizza is provided. Essentially, for one pizza, you choose one shape, one sauce, some topping and some seasoning.



Note that, conversely, each ingredient will (likely) appear in multiple pizza.



## Admin page
I have set up a read-only user so that you can login the admin page and have a look inside.
